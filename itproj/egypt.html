        <p>“Man fears Time, But Time fears the Pyramid.” 
            It is an Arabic proverb that gives us hints about the Egyptian 
            Pyramids’ power. The pyramids of Egypt are built with 
            unexplainable methods and techniques. Consequently,
             multiple questions revolve around it. 
             But important questions are how the pyramids of Egypt were made and 
             who created them. And the more we try to solve these questions, 
             the more we find ourselves in the puzzle.</p>
             <p>Egyptians did not leave any solid clue about how pyramids were made. 
                 However, they left the space for theory, assumptions, 
                 and questions for all of us. Undoubtedly, 
                 witnessing such a structure on your own is a lifetime experience.</p></div>
