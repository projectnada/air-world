            <h3>Brandenburg gate</h3>
            <p>The Brandenburg Gate ( German : Brandenburger Tor ) is the symbol of the city of Berlin, and the gate bears the name of the state of Brandenburg that surrounds the state of Berlin and is located in Pariser Square . Its construction began in 1788 and ended in 1791 , but part of it was destroyed in World War II and then the broken part was rebuilt again.

              Whereas the only remaining gate from the city of Berlin previously represented the division of the city into East and West Berlin, since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 the Brandenburg Gate has come to symbolize German unity. In addition, this gate made of sandstone is one of the finest examples of German classicism. The Brandenburg Gate was built according to plans by Carl Gotthard Longans from 1788 to 1791, modeled on the propylene of the Acropolis of Athens . On either side, six Doric columns support a radial beam about 11 meters deep, which is divided into five portals. In 1793, a quadriga (a carriage drawn by four horses) designed by Johann Gottfried Schadow was placed on the gate, pointing east towards the city centre.<br>
              
              In light of a decision taken by the Berlin Senate, since October 2002 the Brandenburg Gate has been closed to traffic, including buses and taxis</p>

        <h3>history</h3>
        <p>King Ludwig II of Bavaria, known under the name "Mad King Ludwig" , began building the palace at the end of the 19th century from the summer of 1868. The palace was designed by the architect Christian Jank .It took 17 years to build. Up to 8 meters of rock was removed to make room for foundations. In June 1869, the access road to the new palace was ready. On September 5, 1869, the building plan, pictures of buildings, and coins from the reign of Ludwig II were laid in foundation stone. The latest methods were used in construction in terms of technology as well as materials. The rooms of the palace and the royal residence were heated by central heating with hot air. Running water was available on all floors, even hot and cold in the kitchen. The toilets were equipped with automatic washers. The king also had an automatic pager for servants, and there was a telephone line connecting the third and fourth floors, in addition to an elevator, and the cranes were powered by steam engines. The masonry was made of bricks clad only with light limestone.  Neuschweinstein Palace is located near Hohenschwangau Palace , which was built by the fatherLudwig II Maximilian II, former king of Bavaria. Ludwig II was removed from power before the end of the palace construction period, because he squandered state funds on building palaces and other unnecessary matters according to his opponents. Seven weeks after his death in a hitherto unknown manner, the doors of the palace were opened to the public. Many of the masterpieces painted on the walls of the palace were inspired by the works of Wagner , with whom Ludwig II was so fond of. Only 14 of the palace's 360 rooms were decorated and the rest were devoid of any artwork or furniture.
