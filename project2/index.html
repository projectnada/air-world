                 <h3>Volcan Lanin</h3>
                 <p>On the border region between Argentina and Chile is Volcan Lanin, a volcano that is wildly popular with hikers and rock climbers. The truly adventurous can seek permission at the Lanín national park office, show proof of supplies, and then trek to the summit on an often snow-capped route. Alternatively, a short walk of under an hour can take visitors to the Volcán Lanín’s Cara Norte, or north face, which also offers views of the lake called Lago Tromen and the surrounding forest.</p>

                 <h3>Quebrada de Cafayate</h3>
                 <p>Quebrada de Cafayate is a spectacular canyon in the Valles Calchaquíes region. Sandstone, unusual rock formations and bold colors make this is a true bucket-list item for travelers. Organized tours allow for hiking or driving along the Río de las Conchas, traveling into the gorge and the heart of the canyon. In the background, the Sierras de Carahuasi are a bold contrast, creating picture-perfect vistas. Look for landmarks like the iconic monolith known as El Obelisco, the vivid rock formation castles known as Los Castillos and the chalk quarry, which is home to a unusual rock formation called El Fraile, or the monk.

                        <p>This remote Patagonian peninsula is an excellent place to see a phenomenal variety of marine mammals. Depending on the time of year, the peninsula attracts a great number of penguins, sea lions, seals and orcas. Whales can be found in the waters located between the Valdes Peninsula and the Patagonian mainland between May and December. Visitors may also spot foxes, guanacos, rheas, maras, shorebirds and other endemic species on the sparsely populated landmass. The peninsula’s varied geography supports many colonies of protected animals. This diversity makes it one of the best destinations in South America for viewing endemic wildlife.</p>
